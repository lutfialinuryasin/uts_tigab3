Works on MS 2.2 RC2a and up (utf8 encoding is back, no point in removing it).<br />
New in this version:<br />
Works for all vendors, based in or out of the USA (ie. international version).<br />
Added: Debugging option, configurable via the admin<br />
Added: Rates currency conversion option.<br />
Added: Shipping/pickup delay option, as many vendors need several days to process orders<br />
<br />
BUG Fixed: When there was only 1 shipping option returned in the response, the shipping rate shown was 0.<br />
BUG Fixed: Commented out old CRE code, that was messing the Order Editor's totals<br />
Fixed: RateRequestTypes was hardcoded on &quot;LIST&quot; rates. Now it's using the correct configured option from the admin (LIST or ACCOUNT rates, as you select).<br />
<br />
I know that the currency conversion option can be improved, as it needs to be manually modified regularly to match exchange fluctuations, thus if anyone wants to improve this, that would be cool.<br />
If anyone wants to repackage the files into a full package, with clearer instructions etc., please feel free to do so.<br />
<br />
This is NOT a full package. It's just the modified fedexwebservices.php and fedex-common.php5 files.<br />
Thus, uninstall the module, backup the 2 files you already have from the previous version, which are on your server, then copy these 2 files to their correct directories and reinstall the module from the admin.<br />
This is required because the new fedexwebservices.php file has new database entries that it needs to insert.";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 12:05:37 +0200";}i:1;a:4:{s:5:"title";s:12:"View Counter";s:4:"link";s:38:"http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/8781";s:11:"description";s:622:"- Added code to prevent duplicate entries in the ignore list.<br />
- Added a delete button to the block country section to allow deleting blocked entries. <br />
- Changed database install file so it works with 2.3.3.4.<br />
- Changed the country blocking module to use curl if fopen won't work on the server.<br />
- Fixed a problem with the refresh code in 2.3.3.4 shops.<br />
- Fixed a problem with how the ignore list was created. Some IP's would not return as valid.<br />

This is a full package.<br />

Instead of reloading the entire page every time the customer clicks on a link, it only requests the essential parts like updating bodyContent, categories and the best sellers boxes.<br />
<br />
If you have enabled Cache-Control on your server, then most of the pages will only require 1 request instead of 20-50.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the client browser will cache the visited pages with the jQuery .data() method. If a customer press the back/forward button or clicks an already visited link, then the page will load from browser cache and require no requests from the server.<br />
<br />
This Add-On will also implement a server side caching system, using either PHP_APC User Caching if available on your server (Recommended) or otherwise fall back to native file caching.<br />
<br />
To simplify reading the information stored in the page parse time log (page_parse_time.log), I have included an Admin Widget that uses jQuery flot (http://www.flotcharts.org/), similar to the revenue graph included with osCommerce, to create a line chart with mean value of your server's page load time per hour.<br />
